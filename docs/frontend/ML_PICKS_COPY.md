# ML Picks Product Copy (Phase 5)

## Tooltip-sized copy (2–3 sentences)

These picks are ranked by our model using recent performance and matchup context. The list is meant to rank players, not predict a guaranteed outcome. If ML rankings aren’t available, HotBat automatically uses the baseline ranking instead.

## “Learn more” copy (5–7 sentences)

HotBat ranks HR picks using recent form, opponent context, and ballpark effects. The list is designed for ranking, not for guaranteeing a home run on any single play. We don’t show raw probabilities yet because calibration can hurt ranking quality. When ML files aren’t available, the app falls back to the baseline ranking so you still get stable picks. This keeps the experience consistent while we continue to improve the model. Our goal is transparent, explainable rankings—not hype.
