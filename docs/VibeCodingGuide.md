# Vibe Coding Guide (HotBat)

> NOTE: I (the human) will paste my full “Ultimate Vibe Coding Guide” text here.
> For now, assume this file defines the general coding philosophy and etiquette.

Key ideas for the LLM (summary until full text is pasted):

- Write code in **small, logical steps**, not massive rewrites.
- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**.
- Use consistent formatting and naming.
- Explain what you did in a short bullet summary after each major change.
- Group related changes into a single git commit with a meaningful message.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and configuration churn.
